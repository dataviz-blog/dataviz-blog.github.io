## What you'll need —

1. [GitHub](https://github.com "Click to sign up") account — where our blog will live.
   * Requires email
2. [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/ "Click to sign up") account — where our visualisations will come from.
   * Sign up with your GitHub account
   * otherwise, requires email / social media account
   
   


#### Notes on GitHub

* If you have a GitHub account already and have an Organization page (http://[username].github.io), the blog we make later won't work.  You will need to start a new GitHub account (which can be linked to the same email).
    * If your page is a project page — made by creating a 'gh-pages' fork of a repository, don't worry, your current account should be fine.
* If you didn't understand the above, no worries!  Web empowerment awaits.  Just set up an account an all will be well.
