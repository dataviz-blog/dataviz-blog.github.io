layout: post
---
We will build our blog on GitHub with TinyPress, which takes care of all the fuss for us.

We're going to do three things here:

1. Build our blog
2. Make our first post
3. Embed our first plot in our first post



## 1. Build our Blog

If you have a GitHub account take the link below and follow the prompts to start your blog.

<a href='http://tinypress.co' target='_blank'>tinypress.co</a>

* TinyPress will use your GitHub account to build your blog.
* You must give permission to TinyPress to access your GitHub content.
* Once built, your blog will be found at *http://[username].github.io*.

* Note that the *width* and *height* parameters can be changed to suit your post and plot.
